###  Data cleaning and preparations
---

  1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and standardized date formats.
  2. **Pivot Tables**: Created pivot tables to analyze sales by product, region, and period,Total Revenue By Product	
  3. **Visualization**: Used charts to visualize The most Popular Product [Download here][image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efb52924-b204-4f35-a6f7-bde18e753003)
  4. **Formulas**:I Applied Excel functions such as `SUMIF`, `AVERAGE`, and `VLOOKUP` for aggregating data and extracting insights.
     I also Applied Strcuctured Query Language codes like
     ```SQL
    SELECT *FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset_SalesData]

    SELECT Product, 
       SUM([Revenue]) AS TotalRevenue
    FROM [LITA Capstone Dataset_SalesData]
    GROUP BY Product;

    SELECT 
    DATENAME(MONTH, OrderDate) AS SalesMonth, 
    SUM([Quantity_Sold]) AS TotalSales
    FROM 
    [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset_SalesData]
    WHERE 
    YEAR(OrderDate) = YEAR(GETDATE()) 
    GROUP BY 
    DATENAME(MONTH, OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)
    ORDER BY 
    MONTH(OrderDate);  

	    SELECT TOP 5 [CustomerName] , 
       SUM([Revenue]) AS TotalPurchaseAmount
    FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset_CustomerData]
    GROUP BY [CustomerName]
    ORDER BY TotalPurchaseAmount DESC;

    SELECT Region, 
       SUM([Quantity_Sold]) AS TotalSales, 
       ROUND((SUM([Quantity_Sold]) * 100 / (SELECT SUM([Quantity_Sold])
	   FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset_SalesData])), 2) AS SalesPercentage
    FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset_SalesData]
    GROUP BY Region;

    SELECT Product
    FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset_SalesData]
    WHERE Product NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT Product
    FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset_SalesData]
    WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(QUARTER, -1, GETDATE()) 
    )
    GROUP BY Product;
```

	###  Exploratory Data Analysis
---
This involves exploring the the Data to answer some questions which are needful for effective analysis. Questions such as
 - What is the total sales for each product category.
 - What is the number of sales transactions in each region.
 - Which is the highest-selling product by total sales value.
 - calculate total revenue per product.
 - calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
 - find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
 - calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
 - identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

###  Key Findings
- **Sales Trends**:Shoes generates the most Revenue, most commonly bought by the Southerners. There was little or no known record for the product in the North.
  The peak sales period of the products of the company are February and June, with the most sold products being Shoes and Gloves.
